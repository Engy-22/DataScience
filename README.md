Data Science and Data Analysis Projects using Python and R

These are the Data Science and Data Analysis Projects I'm creating

I've used BeautifulSoup or Selenium to scrape data from the web and imported the data into Pandas DataFrame.

I've also used Pandas to read CSV (Comma Separated Values) or Excel files.

Then I used Matplotlib, or Seaborn to create visualization with plans to incorporate Bokeh for interactive plots in future.
